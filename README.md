SXSW Crawler 
=======================

This is a set of scripts for crawling SXSW and getting music for all
the bands. The site format changes every year, different sites change
their APIs and shit breaks. There is no guarantee this will work. 

However, it's an excellent starting place for music discovery. 

I recommend runnning this code mid-Feburary and doing your music
listening from feb-march or so. It takes a long time to listen to
1500-2000 songs.

Artists are usually nailed down by then.

What's new?
=============

Here on 2/1/2018, I don't see SXSW posting the artist event times
anymore. They claim that showtimes will be available in Feb 2018, but
they're not available yet.

The stage1 and stage2 code will focus on getting as much artist
information as possible, in order to download music. I'll have to
write new code (stage3?) to get event data when it comes up.

THE PROCESS
============

I think we've developed an excellent way to discover music at a
festival that regularly hosts over 1500 bands. We're going to take a
bit of a big-data approach here, and process music faster than any A&R
person can.

Much credit for this process goes to jwz who wrote youtubedown and
worked on this with me throughout the last 5 years of SXSW.

The process works like this:

  1. Crawl SXSW. Get all of the HTML for music events during the festival.
  2. Break the work queue down by type (soundcloud, raw mp3, youtube)
  3. Download all of the songs in each type using different mechanisms
  4. Feed into iTunes (manual, just drag the folder into iTunes)
  5. Rate with iTunesRater (github.com/netik/iTunesRater)
  6. Take that library and convert it into a schedule  (./sxsw_to_ical.py)
  7. Take that schedule (as an ICS file) and put it into your phone to have during the event. 
  8. Go see some damn music. 

Caveats: I am not responsible for what you do with these scripts. Most
of the music is copyrighted and you shouldn't steal it. Please don't
abuse the bandwidth of any of the sites or services involved here.

Installation
=============

Python 2.7 required.

FFMPEG required to convert video to mp3.

Dependencies: 

```
  easy_install requests
  easy_install soundcloud
  easy_install mutagen
  easy_install lxml
  easy_install ID3 -- or id3-py-1.2/ included in this directory
  easy_install fuzzy   # for sxsw to ical fuzzy matching
```

If you want to download soundcloud files you will also need Python >
3.0 installed and soundscrape from https://github.com/Miserlou/SoundScrape

youtubedown (get from www.jwz.org/hacks/youtubedown) 
 - Make sure to get a current version of this. It should be in your $PATH

You will also need Valid soundcloud API keys. Get them from Soundcloud
and put them in a file called soundcloud_api_keys.py. make sure the
file looks like this:

```
   client_id='xxxxx'
   client_secret='xxxxx'
```

get_sc_data will use them as part of the soundcloud "best song" determination.

Running
===============

Run the crawl to get data. You should only have to do this once. 

```
  # Crawl the site!
  ./1_run_crawl.sh
```

  This will create data/queue.txt which everything else will key
  off of.

```
  # parse the data set for possible downloads
  ./stage2.py
```

This will parse the HTML event files and log to determine where the
audio files are. Now it's time to download.

*SXSW Raw MP3*

Fortunately, SXSW still posts raw MP3s. We have some work to do to get
the files named correctly and the ID3 tags right, but it's doable...

```
  # Get SXSW mp3 files
  ./download_sx.py 
```

Now, you should have a big, fat directory (music/sx) full of mp3 files.
Run "rename_mp 3_files.py" to rename them from "xxxx.mp3" to "artist -
title.mp3" with proper ID3 tags.

The rename script will try to derive the proper artist and title
name from the SXSW web pages. If it can't do that it'll fall back to
the MP3 ID3 information.

If that doesn't work at all, we'll leave the file alone and you'll be
stuck with the nnnn.mp3 filename, but hopefully not. At that point,
you might want to resort to either exiftool or iTunes to resolve these
issues for you.

Now, get the other file types. Historically, youtube and sound cloud
make up a a small fragment of artists available from sxsw.

*Youtube*

We'll download any youtube link and convert it into an mp3 using ffmpeg and youtubedown. 

```
  ./download_yt.py
  ./fix_yt_names.py
```

Music outputs to music/yt

*Soundcloud*

Make sure you've got your API keys set up as previously described in the Installation section. 

```
  ./get_sc_data.py 
  ./download_sc.py
```

Please note that we are now using soundscrape and python3 to get
soundcloud files. The prior solution no longer works thanks to
Soundcloud API changes.

You also need to know that soundcloud is not issuing new API keys and
that that built-in keys that are inside of soundscrape are maxxed out
at 15,000 downloads a day across all users of soundscrape. If you edit
the soundscrape code (soundscrape.py) and replace them with your valid
keys, this limit will go away and it might work. Otherwise soundscrape
will throw 429 errors all day and you can't download.

Music outputs to music/sc

More about the files 
======================

*SXSW MP3s*

(2013,2014) It used to be that they hosted MP3s for all of the bands
on the SXSW sites for review. These days there's maybe 40-60 songs on
the SXSW site, and the rest are on youtube or otherwise. But, we'll
download those directly.

2016 Update: SXSW seems to be hosting most of their music on their own
again. Yay!

*Youtube*

We can download about 90-100% of youtube files provided youtubedown
can break the ridiculous obfuscation that youtube applies to their
files. We might miss a few, but we get very, very close.

*Soundcloud*

Far more complicated but still possible. Soundcloud artists do not
have songs, they have artist data listed, but we want to hear them to
know if we should bother going to the show.

We need to find their most popular song and download it. Assumption:
"Most Popular" is the hit song that might sell you on the band. (Who
knows!)

  ./get_sc_data.py

Run this ONLY AFTER stage1.py has finished. This will build the sc
metadata catalog.

What do I do after the downloads finish
=======================================

Import them all into iTunes. (see "The Process" above.)

Make a calendar
===============

After you've imported, rated, and listened to all of the songs, go
make your personal calendar.

  ./sxsw_to_ical.py -h 

I usually rate 2 stars and 3 stars if I really want to go. Rarely, if
ever do I rate 4 or 5 stars unless the band is amazing. Note that the
sxsw_to_ical script processes ALL bands in iCal. It does not pick off
just the SXSW ratings. If you rate multiple songs for a single band,
it will use the HIGHEST rating you've given to that band. 

Other Files
=============
There is a bunch of other junk in here that frankly, I forget what
they do.

dedupe.sh* - apparently this was used to dedupe the crawl. dead?
fixnames.py* - I think I used this to rename the downloaded music. 
map_artists.py* - Maybe I used this to find more artists in the crawl
map_url_to_artist.py* - ??
rename_mp3_files.py* - tries to fixup MP3 
rename_no_spaces.py* - remove spaces from youtube files
rename_sc_tracks.py* - clean up soundcloud filenames
stage1.py* - first part of the fetcher
