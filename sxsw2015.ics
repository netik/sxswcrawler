DESCRIPTION:Pop \nBlackburn\, UK-ENGLAND \n \nThere are several points in the 22 year 
 timeline of Charlotte O’Connor that you might attribute to her metamorphosing 
 into Charlotte OC\, future pop star. The first was when she used to dress up as 
 a witch as a child\, stand at the end of her driveway staring at passersby in a 
 long black dress. The last was in November 2012 when she was in Berlin for a co-
 writing session for her debut album. \n Finding herself at the Berghain\, prob
 ably the best nightclub in the world\, on Sunday afternoon\, a new impulse hit t
 he singer/songwriter. ‘I felt like somebody had just let me in on the biggest 
 secret in the world.’ Because the monolithic temple of nightlife and seat of m
 odern bohemianism doesn’t allow cameras or press in\, in some ways they had. A
 new loop for her music began to foment in her mind. ‘It felt like heaven and 
 hell to me.’ \n ‘Certain things that I saw I could not believe\,’ she sa

 rist\, and songwriter based in Calgary\, Alberta. Upon the release of her debut 
 album Tough Cookie in 2011\, the bulk of the critical acclaim it received was ri
 ghtly placed upon her startling\, unique voice\, which seems at once familiar an

 D Weekly\, Saskatoon Star-Phoenix\, and the Vancouver Sun\, and led to a string 
 of CBC and CKUA performances and two acclaimed music videos for her songs \"You 
 Always Come To Mind\" and \"The Score\". \n \n The key to Smith's songs is
 that she has an ability to infuse her songs with a certain timelessness\, invok
 ing a familiarity within each listener\, while still bringing formidable sense o
 f self to the proceedings. This potent combination of traits belies the eclectic
 ness of her own musical touchstones\, which run the gamut from Anita O'Day and K

 \n \n Girl Pilot’s upcoming release\, On My Way (Produced by Brian Beatti

 irst record\, and the soulful alternative folk sound of Okkervil River. The new
 album features 10 original tracks that range from a touching duet with Bill Cal

 a manifesto\, a dare. What would happen if you dismantled assumptions and worke

 Gang of Four’s thrilling and unsettling ninth album\, refers both to the worl

DESCRIPTION:Electronic \nLecce\, ITALY \n \nPopulous is Andrea Mangia’s stage name\,
 a musician and producer born and and raised in Italy in the 90's and 2000’s. 
 He made his debut in 2002 with the album Quipo\, with Morr Music\, a german labe

 Morr also produced his later recordings\, Queue For Love [2005] and Drawn In Bas

 cision of digital sounds and the analog warmth coming from soul music and shoega

 that see him involved over the years\, from Girl With The Gun to LIFE & LIMB.

DESCRIPTION:Electronic \nCopenhagen\, DENMARK \n \nHannes Norrvide’s early solo albu
 ms under the Lust for Youth moniker have been described as “dark\, cold\, aton
 al\, tormented\, lonely\, and lower than lo-fi.” The approach on International
 has shifted dramatically. Writing as a three-piece now\, with longtime live col
 laborator Loke Rahbek and new band member Malthe Fischer\, who produces and play
 s guitar\, LFY have entered a completely new territory. The result is stunning. 
 International is a buoyant synth masterpiece in the vein of early Depeche Mode\,
 Pet Shop Boys and New Order. Norrvide’s work has always had pop sensibilities
 buried deep in the reverb\, but the hooks are front and center on International
 \, and there is nothing lo-fi about it..\ \nhttp://sacredbonesrecords.com/colle

 other hobbies\, they quit their day jobs and went all in\, putting in the hours 
 and the blood (quite literally selling plasma to survive)\, sweat\, and tears to
 create something wholly their own. Written in a studio built from the ground up
 in a former cement factory\, the resulting output is a unique and powerful coll
 ection of neon-lit new wave pop cut with modern rock aesthetics\, led by the ebu
 llient and catchy single\, \"Weekend.” It’s the sound of a band emerging tri
 umphantly from the trials of their past and looking fearlessly into the future..
